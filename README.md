Hi! I'm Mihir, a student at UWaterloo studying Software Engineering. I've previously worked at [Meta](https://www.meta.com/) on AI Agents, [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/products/bloomberg-terminal/) on a C++ compliance engine, and been a founding engineer at a [Node App](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dulcedo-group-acquires-ai-powered-influencer-marketing-startup-node-app-302247029.html).

I like to build and learn new things.
